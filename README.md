# FiveM Blips
This FiveM resource allows you to choose between two versions of blip functionality: one with additional minimap features like health and armor indicators and another without these additions.
# Installation

    Download the fivem-blips folder.
    Place the folder in your FiveM server's resources directory.

# Usage
## With Minimap Features
* Ensure that the fivem-blips resource is started in your server.cfg file.
* When players join your server, they will have access to additional minimap blip features such as health and armor indicators.

## Without Minimap Features
* Navigate to the **/OPTIONAL** folder and overwrite your **/stream** files with the **optional** ones.

## What blips does this include?
Due to the fivem natives website not hosting the new blips, you can find them at [https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Blips](https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Blips)


### Updates
When there is a GTA Online Update that includes new blips, I will try to update this resource.
